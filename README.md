# AutoProtect Group code test

This is creating a small app that holds resources for a maths department at a school. They are looking to have resources to help students with revising square numbers and prime numbers

## Technologies Used

* PHP - used for the main code base and for writing functions and loops to iterate over the information
* jQuery - used to combat an issue with the loop populating blank segements in the table
* Bootstrap - used to make the layout of the pages nicer with the ability to have pages responsive for devices. 
* PHPUnit - used to test the function in here that determines whether a number is prime

## Current Features

* Home Page - This is a simple landing page that gives the students options to go to either the square numbers page or the prime numbers page
* Square Numbers - Page contains a table that shows in bold the square numbers with row and column numbers. Has the ability to increase and decrease both column and row values.
* Prime Numbers - Page contains a table with 10 numbers per row and in bold showing the Prime numbers. The limit can be changed up to 1000 but no higher.
